due to efficiency and secret codes among gamers the word <strong>ELITE</strong> has been shortened to <strong>LEET</strong> and eventually to <strong>1337</strong>. 1337 is a strong part of our culture, it is an attitude that you can feel within as well as outside our offices.</p><p>tretton37 is a fast growing Swedish company with its headquarters set in the university town of Lund, a cornerstone of Swedish knowledge and high-tech industry (Bluetooth, Tetrapak, Sony Ericsson, Alfa Laval,…). When we’ve started our family back in 2010, we were determined to challenge the status quo and the state of the IT industry. We’ve started with humble beginnings, but were actively and confidently fighting bad code, one line at a time. We don’t believe in ties, too much hierarchy and extensive titles. We call ourselves ninjas, we have survived hackathons, were chosen among the most desirable employers in Sweden and were awarded for having the most envious office spaces and working environments.</p><p>We are particularly proud of our attitude towards people, our contributions to the community and the quality which we consistently deliver to our clients. We are different in our culture and our day-to-day life. We strongly believe and invest in knowledge, our mission “Creating value by sharing knowledge” is with us on every step of our journey. We are a company, where there is no such thing as a stupid question and where someone is always willing to help you out, no prestige and no egos. We give back to the community by organising one of the biggest nordic conferences - <a href="https://leetspeak.se/">leetspeak</a>.</p><p><img alt="tretton37 ninjas" src="http://ljubljana-job-ads.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sair.jpg" style="max-width:100%"></p><p>Our growing international family resides in six offices and currently brings together 170 passionate and handpicked craftsmen from all sorts of backgrounds. We would like to invite you to embark on a fresh and exciting journey. A journey where we promise that the combination of our family, our values and culture will always come first. In addition to a competitive compensation and other benefits, we promise that you will have all the conditions and opportunities to grow, excel, take care of your wellbeing, be surrounded with skilled craftsmen, encounter challenges within exciting projects, have fun, explore international destinations while having a healthy work and family time balance.</p><p>Today we are one of the leading IT consultancy and custom software development companies in Sweden. We like to get involved with a project at the most exciting time - its creation. It is there that we can influence and set high technology standards, infrastructure requirements and start our hardcore development process.<br>Most of our projects are coded in JavaScript, .NET or JAVA. Our projects are diverse, interesting, technologically advanced and full of exciting challenges to conquer. We cover the entire product and service pipeline, from bits and flags, high performance scalable Back-ends to stunning interfaces for all devices. In addition to our customer projects, we also run and invest into our own startup incubator <a href="http://1337works.com">1337 Works</a>, where we nurture and grow the leading products of tomorrow.</p><h1><a id="You_had_me_at_hello__how_do_I_apply_106"></a>You had me at hello - how do I apply?</h1><p>Ready to join us?
